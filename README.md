Mind love is an educational website that provides every detailed information on the various types of addiction that are tearing apart families and the mental health of our young and upcoming geneartion.
The website is totally free and we believe with collaboration with other NGO'S or the government, the website will be able to provide  more than just educational facts but also physical counselling and therapies.
Our main vision is to help as many people, especially the young, to come up victorious in their addiction buddens.
